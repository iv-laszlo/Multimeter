# Multimeter

Digital Multimeter
This project is a custom-built Digital Multimeter developed by a student team, as part of an academic project. The device is capable of measuring voltage, current, and resistance, and was designed from the ground up using embedded systems and custom PCB design.

Features
Measures DC voltage, current, resistance, and temperature

Built using a microcontroller with analog signal processing

Designed in KiCad for schematic and PCB layout

Fully functional firmware written in C/C++

Simple and intuitive user interface

Tools & Technologies
Microcontroller: Aruino Nano [ATmega328P]

KiCad: PCB and schematic design

C/C++: Firmware development

Multimeter principles: Analog signal acquisition, ADC, display interface
